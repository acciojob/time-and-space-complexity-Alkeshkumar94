<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. 
    Efficient algorithms strive to have lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution for larger inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> 
    refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as it runs. Algorithms with better <b>space complexity</b> 
    consume less memory, which can be crucial in memory-constrained environments. One common notation to 
    represent <b>space complexity</b> is O(n), where n is the size of the input.</p>
